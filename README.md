# ASDU page

ASDU is a new platform for the Software Development study group, it describes us personally and our interests. The main objective is to help users find information about what we are and what we do.

To do so, we are creating a new web application that allows users to meet us and explore among sophisticated things.

## What you have to do?

ASDU page needs you to implement some awesome components where users can see information about all new updates.

## What do you need to start?

**01.-** If you have **git**, you need to clone the repository starting by copying the link like so:

**01.- Live Server:** For this option you have to download the extension as in the following image:
